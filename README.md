## 01. Executive summary

Breezio, a fictional 300-person company, handles roughly 600 employee service
requests a month across IT, HR, Facilities, and Finance. Every one of them arrives
by email, chat, or walk-up. There is no single front door, no request ID, no
routing logic, and no service levels.

This project designs and builds a service hub that gives every request one entry
point and one ID, classifies and routes it with AI where the model is confident,
sends it to a person where it is not, and puts volume, speed, and service-level
performance on a live dashboard.

**Modeled current-state cost:** 2,772 coordinator hours a year, roughly $124,740,
spent moving requests around rather than resolving them. This is a modeled figure
with the assumptions shown in [`docs/process-maps.md`](docs/process-maps.md). It is not a measured result.

## 02. Business case

| Activity | Annual hours (modeled) |
|---|---|
| Initial triage and forwarding | 720 |
| Misroute rework | 216 |
| Missing-information follow-up | 540 |
| Approval chasing | 288 |
| Status inquiry handling | 360 |
| Manual logging | 360 |
| Month-end reporting | 288 |
| **Total** | **2,772** |

At $45 per hour, about $124,740 a year. Employee waiting time and the cost of
delay are excluded because they cannot be defended without real data.

## 03. Current-state process

Requests arrive through five channels. Coordinators read, forward, ask for
missing details, chase approvals, and answer "any update?" emails by hand.
Full narrative and swimlane map: [`docs/process-maps.md`](docs/process-maps.md).

## 04. Pain points

Eleven pain points, PP-01 to PP-11, each mapped to a KPI or an open question.
The largest: 18% of requests misrouted, 30% missing information at intake, and
no way to measure service levels because none exist.

## What this project does not claim

- The baselines are modeled for a fictional company, not measured anywhere.
- ROI is modeled, with every assumption shown.
- AI accuracy is not stated until a hand-labeled evaluation is published in Slice 2.
- This is not a replacement for an enterprise service management platform.

## A note on the data

Breezio, its employees, and its requests are fictional. No real organization,
person, or request is represented.
